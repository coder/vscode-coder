# Coder VSCode Extension - Quality Improvement Plan

## Phase 1: Test Infrastructure & Coverage âœ… COMPLETED

- **405 unit tests** passing with 78.49% overall coverage
- **69 integration tests** passing
- **18 files** with >90% coverage
- Established TDD workflow and testing patterns

## Phase 2: Structured Logging Implementation âœ… COMPLETED

### Completed

- [x] Logger class with levels (ERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG) - 98.44% coverage
- [x] VS Code output channel integration with verbose setting support
- [x] Backward compatibility via writeToCoderOutputChannel method
- [x] Test factory createMockOutputChannelWithLogger for consistent testing
- [x] Verified Logger works with existing error.ts Logger interface

### Next Steps

1. **Replace writeToCoderOutputChannel calls** (43 instances across 10 files)
   - âœ… remote.ts (18) - Completed with Logger integration test
   - âœ… extension.ts (8) - Completed with Logger initialization and test
   - âœ… headers.ts (4) - Completed via Logger interface compatibility
   - âœ… workspaceMonitor.ts (3) - Completed via Storage interface compatibility
   - âœ… inbox.ts (3) - Completed via Storage interface compatibility
   - âœ… error.ts (2) - Completed via Logger interface compatibility
   - âœ… workspacesProvider.ts (1) - Completed via Storage interface compatibility
   - âœ… commands.ts (1) - Completed via Storage interface compatibility
   - âœ… All 43 instances now use Logger through Storage or interface compatibility
2. **Add structured logging to high-value areas**
   - API calls and responses
   - Connection establishment/failures
   - Certificate errors
   - Command execution

## Phase 3: Code Quality Improvements

### Test Quality âœ… COMPLETED

- [x] test-helpers.ts with comprehensive mock factories (30+ factory functions)
- [x] Reduced `as any` casts from 95 to 4 (96% reduction)
- [x] api.test.ts cleanup - removed eslint-disable and all inline mocks
- [x] Consolidated all test mocks into reusable factory functions
- [x] Migrated all test files to use consistent mock patterns

### Refactoring Priority

1. **extension.ts** (39.71% â†’ 93.07% coverage âœ… COMPLETED) - Refactored monolithic activate() function

   Successfully extracted all 9 helper functions using TDD:

   - [x] setupRemoteSSHExtension() - Configure remote SSH extension
   - [x] initializeInfrastructure() - Create storage and logger
   - [x] initializeRestClient() - Setup REST client
   - [x] setupTreeViews() - Create workspace providers and trees
   - [x] registerUriHandler() - Handle vscode:// URIs
   - [x] registerCommands() - Register all VS Code commands
   - [x] handleRemoteEnvironment() - Setup remote workspace if needed
   - [x] checkAuthentication() - Verify user auth and fetch workspaces
   - [x] handleAutologin() - Process autologin configuration

2. **remote.ts** (49.21% coverage) - break down 400+ line methods
3. **commands.ts** (64.19% coverage) - create UI abstraction layer

## Phase 4: Connection Reliability & API Consolidation

- [ ] Implement exponential backoff for retries
- [ ] Add connection health monitoring with Logger
- [ ] Create API/CLI abstraction layer
- [ ] Migrate to CLI-first approach where possible

## Success Metrics

| Metric                   | Target | Current | Status      |
| ------------------------ | ------ | ------- | ----------- |
| Unit test coverage       | 80%+   | 78.49%  | ðŸ”„ Progress |
| Integration tests        | 60+    | 69      | âœ… Complete |
| Logger adoption          | 100%   | 100%    | âœ… Complete |
| Files with <50% coverage | 0      | 1       | ðŸ”„ Progress |
| Test mock consolidation  | 100%   | 100%    | âœ… Complete |

## Immediate Next Steps

1. **Refactor remote.ts (49.21% coverage)**
   - Break down 400+ line methods into testable units
   - Apply TDD approach similar to extension.ts
   - Target: 49.21% â†’ 80%+ coverage

2. **Improve commands.ts coverage (68.03%)**
   - Create UI abstraction layer for better testability
   - Add tests for uncovered command handlers
   - Target: 68.03% â†’ 80%+ coverage
