# Coder VSCode Extension - Quality Improvement Plan

## Phase 1: Test Infrastructure & Coverage ✅ COMPLETED

### Testing Achievements Summary
- **350 unit tests** passing with 73.18% overall coverage
- **69 integration tests** passing with comprehensive command coverage
- **18 files** with >90% coverage
- **Zero test failures** across entire test suite

### Key Testing Milestones
- [x] Achieved 70%+ unit test coverage (up from ~3% baseline)
- [x] Comprehensive integration test suite covering all user-facing commands
- [x] Test infrastructure supporting both unit and integration testing
- [x] Consistent testing patterns established across codebase

## Phase 2: Structured Logging Implementation 🔄 IN PROGRESS

### 2.1 Structured Logging Foundation ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Created Logger class with log levels (ERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG)
- [x] Implemented VS Code output channel integration
- [x] Added log level filtering based on `coder.verbose` setting
- [x] Support for structured data (JSON serialization)
- [x] LoggerService for configuration integration
- [x] 100% test coverage with TDD approach

### 2.2 Logging Integration 🔄 IN PROGRESS

#### Current State Analysis
- 45+ locations using `writeToCoderOutputChannel` 
- No consistent error logging strategy
- No performance metrics or request/response logging
- No correlation IDs for operation tracking

#### Implementation Plan

**Phase 2.2.1: Replace Existing Logging**
- [ ] Replace all `writeToCoderOutputChannel` calls with new Logger
- [ ] Add appropriate log levels to existing log statements
- [ ] Maintain backward compatibility with output format

**Phase 2.2.2: Enhanced Error Tracking**
- [ ] Add correlation IDs for operation tracking
- [ ] Include stack traces for errors
- [ ] Log request/response data (sanitized)
- [ ] Track user actions that trigger errors

**Phase 2.2.3: Performance Monitoring**
- [ ] Track operation durations
- [ ] Log slow operations automatically
- [ ] Monitor resource usage
- [ ] Track active connections

**Phase 2.2.4: Customer Support Features**
- [ ] Log export command with sanitization
- [ ] Include system diagnostics
- [ ] Network connectivity status logging
- [ ] Certificate validation logging

## Phase 3: Code Quality Improvements

### 3.1 Refactoring for Testability
- [ ] Extract complex logic from `extension.ts` (38.68% coverage)
- [ ] Break down `remote.ts` setup method (449 lines)
- [ ] Create UI abstraction layer for `commands.ts`
- [ ] Implement dependency injection patterns

### 3.2 API and CLI Consolidation
- [ ] Document all API interaction points
- [ ] Create abstraction layer for API/CLI switching
- [ ] Migrate to CLI-first approach
- [ ] Remove direct API dependencies where possible

## Phase 4: Connection Reliability

### 4.1 Connection Improvements
- [ ] Implement exponential backoff
- [ ] Add connection health monitoring
- [ ] Improve error recovery
- [ ] Add connection telemetry

## Success Metrics

| Metric | Target | Current | Status |
|--------|--------|---------|---------|
| Unit test coverage | 90%+ | 73.18% | 🔄 In Progress |
| Integration test coverage | 80%+ | 69 tests | ✅ Achieved |
| Structured logging adoption | 100% | 5% | 🔄 In Progress |
| Complex function refactoring | 0 functions >50 lines | TBD | ⏳ Planned |
| Connection reliability | <1% failure rate | TBD | ⏳ Planned |

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Continue logging integration across codebase
2. **Short-term**: Complete Phase 2 logging implementation
3. **Medium-term**: Begin refactoring complex functions for testability
4. **Long-term**: Implement connection reliability improvements

## Notes

- Maintain TDD approach for all new features
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
- Regular code reviews for all changes
- Update metrics weekly
